PodToHTML generates HTML from one or (more typically) several files
containg POD documentation.

It uses Pod::Parser to parse the PODs and HTML::Element to represent the 
HTML as it is generated. 

This release is compatible with Pod::Parser version 1.061

The distribution also includes Pod::Links for parsing L<> constructs.
